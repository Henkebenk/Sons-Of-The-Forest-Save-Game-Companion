# Sons Of The Forest | Save Game Companion
This program allows you to edit Sons of the Forest savefiles for different functions like regrowing trees or reviving companions.

## Prerequisites
In order to use this program, you will need to have JDK 19 installed on your system. Which you can grab [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html). (Without this you will get a the error message "A Java exception has occured" when running the .jar file)
  
## Features
### Player
* The ability to change stats such as Health, Energy and rest
* Add/remove ammunition and throwables

### Companions
* The ability to change stats such as Health, Energy and Affection
* Revive them if they have died
* Teleport them to the player
* Teleport them to each other
* Show their inventory

### Enviroment
* The ability to regrow all trees and plants
* Regrow only stumps that you left
* Load the enviroment state from another save

### Other
* The menu (since Beta 1.0.4) has an automatic backup system, meaning it creates a backup of your save when pressing the "save changes" button 
* The ability to change game difficulty (Not fully implemented)
  
## .jar VS .exe
If you have issues with the .jar version, grab the .exe version instead, and place it in the same directory
  
## Usage
1. Download the SOTF-SGC.jar file from the repository.
2. Place the .jar file in the same folder as your Singleplayer and Multiplayer folders are in the save folders directory. For example: C: > Users > [User] > AppData > LocalLow > Endnight > Sons of the Forest > Saves > 76561198082060965 > [Place .jar here]
3. Run the .jar file inside the folder and edit your savegame to your preference:)
4. Load the save game in SOTF (Note that this process can be done while in game, but you still have to reload)

## Current work
I appreciate any form of feedback on my work and I currently plan to add more functions to it, so keep the suggestions coming. Things i am/will be working on are:
* Savable spawnpoints for you and your companions to teleport to
* Toggle the gps locator shown on the map
* Implement a filechooser so that you can place your .jar anywhere
  
## Known issues
* Setting the difficulty seems to revert to earlier state when loading game
